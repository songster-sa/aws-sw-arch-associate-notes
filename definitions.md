Throughput = rate of production = how much is passing through the application

distributed applications = program running on multiple computers in a n/w, and communicating = client and server app on different computers
= globally distributed app

map reduce = programming model or pattern = splits the input data-set into independent chunks which are processed by the tasks in a completely parallel manner
= big data processing

multi tenant = the mode of operation of software where multiple independent (instances of one or multiple) applications operate in a shared environment. The instances (tenants) are logically isolated, but physically integrated

single tenant = A single instance of the software and supporting infrastructure serve a single customer. With single tenancy, each customer has his or her own independent database and instance of the software.
